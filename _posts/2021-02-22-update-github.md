title: "Moving this blog to write.as"
---

I decide to moving this blog to write.as since I discovered Github was acquisition by Microsoft in 2018. This is quite surpise to me, because Github is a place that many open source project was hold, and it's fool me that Github was formerly created for that purpose. However it's not true since the Github was closed source itself in the beginning. I don't prefer closed source in general and Big Tech especially Microsoft in particular.

I knows write.as for a while but still decide to create a blog from scratch which I have no knowledge about, therefore it's hard to maintain sicne my focus should be writing whenever I need. I hoping from Linux to BSD and the engine I used to build my blog on github is somewhat incompatible. Which make me thing, why not doing it in a simple way by using Write.as? As I have read their privacy policy, it's clean, short and simple to understand. More importantly, I respect a service that respect their users, and Write.as seem promising and it's trusted by many FOSS users.

Anyway, I am moving from mrhieu059.github.io to hieucao.write.as from now on, 02-22-2021.
