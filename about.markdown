## Here is a small piece of myself.
I'm 21 years old, a quite person. I tend to input more than output, listen more than speak.

I don't have any special skills nor consistant to learn anything. 
Sometime I wish I could be a little more persistant with my decision but it never happen.

I have a special love with opensource software and even though I'm not a programmer nor CS student. I consider myself as a FOSS `Free and Open Source Software` enthusiast. 

After decided to quit Facebook and most popular services owned by Facebook, Google and Microsoft. The idea of having a mini blog appeal. Quiting those things doesn't mean I will disconnect with the world, but I want to connect with it my way. Probably through this mini dumb blog, I think this is the right time for me to start a new journey. 

By the way, I never thought I would like to write. Since I'm a kid I always afraid to share my idea. I afraid people will laugh at me, and I don't like it feeling. However, as I getting more and more to know about myself. I think I'm not that bad, and I love myself, I need to embrace and be gentle to myself.
Therefore I gave myself a permission to make mistake, and do whatever I think is best for me.

And Yeahh, here I am with a dumb blog :)
